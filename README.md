# TapeCalc
## A cross platform ribbon calculator.

This project was created out of necessity as I used to use a similar application on windows to do my monthly finances.  When I moved to linux I could not find a calculator that acted in the same way as what I used to use on windows, so I made one.

TapeCalc is in it's infancy still, as I have many more things I would like to add to it; however the base functionality that I needed is now there.  
The application is fairly simple, it consists of an editor window and buttons accross the top. To perform calculations, start entering numbers and using the - + * / keys will automatically move you down to the next line to add more operands.  The line will not be totaled until you press enter and any text you have in the line (and numbers after that text) will be considered a comment and not operated on.

## Bug Reports

Please feel free to reach out with any bugs that you have encountered.  As this project is still in its early stages I fully expect bugs to surface that I have not thought of to test.

## Development

I currently maintain this project on a locally hosted git instance and do frequent commits there.  I only update this repository when I am ready for publishing a release.  If you have suggestions or wish to add code, please contact me so I can update the repository with the latest code before you make a branch.
